description: "When everything competes for attention."

As someone who grew up in the 90s, I find something very special about technology from that era.

I remember trading Pokémon on my Game Boy at school, rushing home to play PlayStation on a CRT, and walking to the video rental store on Fridays to pick a VHS for the weekend. I also remember listening to my favorite tapes on a Walkman until they were stretched thin and barely sounded right, and wearing a Casio F-91W that felt like the peak of technology.

It could just be nostalgia, but I think these things felt special because there were fewer distractions, fewer conveniences, and fewer alternatives competing for attention.

Modern life, by contrast, fragments our focus through multitasking, algorithms, and efficiency-driven habits. That's one of the reasons why, in recent years, I've been gravitating more and more toward these older technologies.

Whether it's gaming, music, or even just checking the time, they encourage a focused, distraction-free experience rather than something optimized or multitasked.

It's a deliberate choice I made to slow down, embrace a bit of inefficiency, and rediscover the joy that comes from being fully present.
